## User Controls

- User controls are containers into which you can put markup and Web server controls.
- UserControl file has .ascx extension.
- An ASP.NET Web user control is similar to a complete ASP.NET Web page (.aspx file), with both a user interface page and code. 
- You create the user control in much the same way you create an ASP.NET page
- The user control does not have html, body, or form elements in it. These elements must be in the hosting page.
- You can use the same HTML elements (except the html, body, or form elements) and Web controls on a user control.
- The code in User Control can be reused .
